RNP is a community effort for a more secure Internet --
thanks to our committed partners and fellow contributors!

== For developers

RNP core code and related projects are all hosted
at the https://github.com/rnpgp[RNP GitHub organization]
as open-source software.

Any contribution (bugfixes, enhancements) are much appreciated.


== For technical writers

RNP has applied for support from the
https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs[Google Seasons of Docs]
program.

We are committed to making the application process and participation
accessible to everyone -- please feel free to reach out and we will
do our best to accommodate your needs.

If you are interested in participating in the GSoD program for RNP,
please apply at the https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/discussions[Discussions page]
or directly contact open.source@ribose.com.

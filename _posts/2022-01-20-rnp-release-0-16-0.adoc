  Introduces OpenSSL backend support, and customizable security profiles for
  enhanced cryptographic policy control
---

RNP 0.16.0 represents a major milestone in the project's evolution, introducing
OpenSSL backend support and customizable security profiles.

This release significantly enhances RNP's flexibility, security, and
compatibility with other OpenPGP implementations.

== Introduction

This release marks a transformative moment for RNP, introducing two major
features that expand its utility and security capabilities. The addition of
OpenSSL backend support broadens deployment options, while the new security
profiles system enables fine-grained control over cryptographic policies.

Key highlights:

* <<openssl-backend,OpenSSL backend support>> for flexible deployment options
* <<security-profiles,Customizable security profiles>> for granular cryptographic control
* <<hash-policies,Enhanced hash algorithm policies>> for improved security

Other highlights:

* Configurable compile-time feature switches
* Improved signature validation mechanisms
* Enhanced cross-platform compatibility
* Extended FFI capabilities
* Optimized CLI tools with better usability
* Performance improvements for large-scale operations

[[openssl-backend]]
== Major feature improvements

=== OpenSSL backend support

The introduction of https://www.openssl.org[OpenSSL] backend support is a
game-changing addition that offers several advantages.

OpenSSL is the most widely deployed and used cryptographic library in the world,
powering the majority of HTTPS connections on the internet. It provides a robust,
commercial-grade, full-featured toolkit for Transport Layer Security (TLS) and
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocols, as well as a general-purpose cryptography
library.

* Eliminates the requirement for https://botan.randombit.net[Botan] installation
* Enables RNP usage on systems with OpenSSL as the primary cryptographic library
* Provides alternative implementation choices for different deployment scenarios
* Improves integration with existing OpenSSL-based systems

This feature allows RNP to be built and used on systems without Botan installed,
making it more accessible and easier to deploy in various environments.

[[security-profiles]]
=== Security profile system

The new security profiles system provides unprecedented control over
cryptographic policies:

* Customizable security rules for different usage scenarios
* Fine-grained control over algorithm acceptance
* Temporal validation of cryptographic algorithms
* Configurable policy enforcement

This system helps organizations implement and maintain their specific security
requirements while ensuring compliance with evolving cryptographic standards.

== Security enhancements

[[hash-policies]]
=== Hash algorithm policy improvements

Stricter policies have been implemented for older hash algorithms:

* SHA1 signatures produced after January 19, 2019 (2019-01-19), are now marked as invalid
* MD5 signatures produced after January 1, 2012 (2012-01-01), are now marked as invalid
* SHA1 and 3DES have been removed from default key preferences
* SHA1 collision detection code has been implemented

=== Signature validation enhancements

Several enhancements to signature validation have been made:

* Signatures with unknown critical notation are now marked as invalid
* Secret key validation occurs before first operation
* More robust key material validation procedures
* Limited number of possible message recipients/signatures to 16k

== Compatibility improvements

=== Cross-platform support enhancements

The release includes several important compatibility fixes:

* Resolved x25519 secret key export compatibility with GnuPG
* Fixed support for Gnu/Hurd systems lacking `PATH_MAX`
* Improved support for old RSA sign-only/encrypt-only keys
* Enhanced ElGamal key support for sizes larger than 3072 bits

=== Build system improvements

New compile-time options provide better control over feature sets:

* `ENABLE_AEAD` for AEAD encryption support
* `ENABLE_SM2` for SM2/SM3/SM4 algorithm support
* `ENABLE_BRAINPOOL` for Brainpool curves
* `ENABLE_TWOFISH` for Twofish algorithm

== Developer improvements

=== FFI enhancements

New FFI functions have been added to support the latest features:

* `rnp_backend_string()` and `rnp_backend_version()`
* `rnp_key_25519_bits_tweaked()` and `rnp_key_25519_bits_tweak()`
* Security profile manipulation functions
* `rnp_signature_get_expiration()`

=== Command-line interface improvements

The CLI has been significantly improved:

* New detailed help messages for both `rnp` and `rnpkeys`
* Support for stdin/stdout/env input/output specifiers
* New `--notty` option for batch processing
* Enhanced key editing capabilities with `--edit-key`

== Performance improvements

Several optimizations have been implemented:

* Reduced memory usage for keys with many signatures
* Improved key import performance
* Better handling of large ElGamal keys
* Optimized signature subpacket processing

== Looking ahead

RNP 0.16.0 establishes a strong foundation for future development with its
flexible backend support and customizable security policies. The improvements in
this release demonstrate RNP's commitment to:

* Providing deployment flexibility
* Maintaining strong security standards
* Improving compatibility with other implementations
* Enhancing developer experience

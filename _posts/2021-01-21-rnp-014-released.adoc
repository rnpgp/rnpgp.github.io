RNP 0.14.0 represents a major milestone in the project's evolution, introducing
Windows support and comprehensive improvements across key validation,
compatibility, and security.

This release significantly expands RNP's platform support while enhancing its
robustness and usability.

== Introduction

This release marks a transformative moment for RNP, bringing Windows platform
support through both link:https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/[MSVC] and
link:https://www.msys2.org/[MinGW/MSYS2] build systems. Additionally, it
introduces substantial improvements to key validation, memory management, and
compatibility with other OpenPGP implementations.

Key highlights:

* <<windows-support,Windows platform support>> via MSVC and MinGW/MSYS2
* <<key-validation,Enhanced key validation>> with stricter requirements
* <<security-improvements,Improved security measures>> and memory management

Other highlights:

* Comprehensive FFI enhancements for better integration
* Improved CLI tools with new key management features
* Better compatibility with other OpenPGP implementations
* Optimized memory usage and performance
* Enhanced error handling and logging
* Migration to C++ and Python 3 for testing


[[windows-support]]
== Platform support improvements

=== Windows build system support

A major achievement in this release is the addition of comprehensive Windows
support:

* Build system support for both MSVC and MinGW/MSYS2
* Native Windows file system compatibility
* Support for widechar parameters and file names
* Integration with Windows development tools

This expansion makes RNP a truly cross-platform solution, enabling:

* Broader deployment options
* Better integration with Windows applications
* Consistent behavior across operating systems
* Enhanced developer experience on Windows

[[key-validation]]
== Key management improvements

=== Key validation

* Improved key validation: require to have at least one valid, non-expiring self signature
* Added support for 'stripped' keys without userids and certifications but with valid subkey binding signature
* Fixed secret key locking when it is updated with new signatures/subkeys
* Fixed key expiry/flags calculation (take in account only the latest valid self-signature/subkey binding)
* Implemented userid validity checks so only certified/non-expired/non-revoked userid may be searched
* Changed behaviour to use latest encryption subkey by default

=== Smart card integration

* Added basic support for GnuPG's offline primary keys (`gnupg --export-secret-subkeys`) and secret keys stored on card

[[security-improvements]]
== Security improvements

=== Memory management enhancements

Several improvements reduce memory usage and improve efficiency:

* Optimized memory usage for keys with many signatures
* Improved key/uid signatures access performance
* Better memory handling during packet processing
* Reduced memory leaks in error conditions

=== Security hardening

Multiple security improvements:

* Removed version headers from armored messages
* Enhanced fuzzing coverage via oss-fuzz
* Fixed static analyzer issues
* Updated to Botan 2.14.0 minimum requirement

=== Other issues

* Fixed MDC reading if it appears on 8k boundary
* Fixed leading zeroes for secp521r1 b & n field constants
* Allowed keys and signatures with invalid MPI bit count
* Fixed support for old RSA sign-only/encrypt-only and ElGamal encrypt-and-sign keys
* Fixed support for ElGamal keys larger than 3072 bits
* Replaced usage of deprecated `botan_pbkdf()` with `botan_pwdhash()`


== Compatibility improvements

=== Legacy algorithm support

Enhanced support for various key types and algorithms:

* Improved handling of RSA sign-only and encrypt-only keys
* Better support for ElGamal keys larger than 3072 bits
* Fixed secp521r1 curve parameter handling
* Support for private/experimental signature subpackets, used by GnuPG and other implementations
* Support for reserved/placeholder signatures

These improvements ensure:

* Better interoperability with older systems
* Support for legacy key formats
* Improved compatibility with other OpenPGP implementations
* More robust key processing

=== Format handling improvements

Significant improvements in message format handling:

* Better processing of armored messages
* Support for zero-size userid/attr packet
* Support for unknown experimental s2ks
* Improved text-mode signature handling
* Enhanced CR character handling in text documents

=== Other issues

* Fixed GnuPG compatibility issues with CR (`\r`) characters in text-mode and cleartext-signed documents
* Fixed support for widechar parameters/file names on Windows

== Performance optimizations

=== Memory management

Several improvements reduce memory usage and improve efficiency:

* Significantly reduced memory usage for keys with large number of signatures
* Improved performance of the key/uid signatures access
* Fixed multiple memory leaks related to invalid algorithms/versions/etc.
* Fixed symbol visibility so only FFI functions are exposed outside of the library

=== Robustness improvements

Enhanced error handling and stability:

* Limited allowed nesting levels for OpenPGP packets
* Relaxed packet dumping, ignoring invalid packets and allowing to find wrong packets easier
* Improved logging of errored keys/subkeys information for easier debugging
* Disabled logging by default in release builds and added support for environment variable `RNP_LOG_CONSOLE` to enable it back


== Command-line interface enhancements

=== Key management

New key management capabilities:

* Flexible password handling options

** Do not load keyring when it is not required, avoiding extra `keyring not found` output.
** Input/output data via the tty, if available, instead of stdin/stdout.
** Fixed possible crash when HOME variable is not set.

* `rnpkeys`
** New `--import-sigs` argument and changed behavior of `--import` to check
whether input is key or signature.
** New `--export-rev` command to export key's revocation, parameters `--rev-type`, `--rev-reason`.
** New `--revoke-key` command.
** New `--permissive` parameter to `--import-keys` command.
** New `--password` options, allowing to specify password and/or generate unprotected key.

=== Usability improvements

Better user experience through:

* Smarter keyring loading
* Improved TTY handling
* Better error messages
* More flexible import options

== Developer interface improvements

=== Enhanced FFI capabilities

Comprehensive new FFI functions for:

* Key validation and status checking
* Signature management
* Protection information retrieval
* Autocrypt compatibility

New keystore type constants:

* `RNP_KEYSTORE_*`

New FFI functions:

* `rnp_import_signatures`.
* `rnp_key_export_revocation`.
* `rnp_key_revoke`.
* `rnp_request_password`.
* `rnp_key_set_expiration` to update key's/subkey's expiration time.

* `rnp_op_verify_get_protection_info` to check mode and cipher used to encrypt message.
* functions to retrieve recipients information (`rnp_op_verify_get_recipient_count`, `rnp_op_verify_get_symenc_count`, etc.).
* `rnp_output_pipe` allowing to write data from input to the output.
* `rnp_output_armor_set_line_length` allowing to change base64 encoding line length.
* `rnp_key_export_autocrypt` to export public key in autocrypt-compatible format.
* functions to retrieve information about the secret key's protection (`rnp_key_get_protection_type`, etc.).
* `rnp_uid_get_type`, `rnp_uid_get_data`, `rnp_uid_is_primary`.
* `rnp_uid_is_valid`.
* `rnp_key_get_revocation_signature` and `rnp_uid_get_revocation_signature`.
* `rnp_signature_get_type`.

* `rnp_key_is_valid` and `rnp_key_valid_till`.

New FFI flags:

* flag `RNP_LOAD_SAVE_PERMISSIVE` to `rnp_import_keys`, allowing to skip erroneous packets.
* flag `RNP_LOAD_SAVE_SINGLE`, allowing to import keys one-by-one.
* flag `RNP_KEY_REMOVE_SUBKEYS` to `rnp_key_remove` function.

Others:

* Fixed documentation for the `rnp_unload_keys` function.

* Enhanced fuzzing coverage
* Fixed static analyzer issues
* Updated cryptographic dependencies

* Migrated most of the internal code to C++
* Updated test suite to Python 3
* Better string handling
** Replaced `strcpy` calls with `std::string` and `memcpy` where applicable
* Improved temporary file management
** Removed usage of `mktemp`, replacing it with `mkstemp`

* Fixed long armor header lines processing
* Fixed primary key binding signature validation when hash algorithm differs from the one used in the subkey binding signature
* Fixed possible crashes during processing of malformed armored input
* Fixed support for text-mode signatures

== Looking ahead

RNP 0.14.0 establishes a stronger foundation for future development through:

* Expanded platform support
* Enhanced security measures
* Improved developer interfaces
* Better compatibility

These improvements demonstrate RNP's commitment to being a robust, secure, and user-friendly OpenPGP implementation.

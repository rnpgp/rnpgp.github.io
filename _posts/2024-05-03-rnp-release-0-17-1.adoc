  Enhanced SHA-1 signature handling, raw encryption support, and improved backend
  features detection, along with Botan 3 and OpenSSL 3 improvements.
---

The RNP 0.17.1 release marks a significant step forward in cryptographic backend
support, introducing compatibility with Botan 3 while enhancing OpenSSL 3
integration.

This release strengthens RNP's position as a flexible OpenPGP implementation by
expanding its cryptographic backend options and improving interoperability.

== Introduction

RNP continues to evolve as a modern OpenPGP implementation, and this release
focuses on ensuring broad compatibility with major cryptographic libraries.

The addition of Botan 3 support alongside enhanced OpenSSL 3 capabilities gives
users and developers more flexibility in choosing their preferred cryptographic
backend while maintaining RNP's high security standards.

== Cryptographic backend enhancements

=== Botan 3 support

The introduction of https://botan.randombit.net/[Botan 3] support represents a
major advancement for RNP.

Botan 3 brings several improvements over its predecessor:

* Modern https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B17[C++17] codebase for better type
safety and performance

* Improved side-channel resistance

* Enhanced platform support

* Updated cryptographic algorithms and implementations

This addition ensures that RNP users can leverage the latest features and
security improvements from the Botan cryptographic library while maintaining
backward compatibility.

=== OpenSSL 3 improvements

The enhanced https://www.openssl.org/[OpenSSL 3] support builds upon RNP's
existing OpenSSL backend integration. OpenSSL 3 introduced significant changes
in its architecture and API, including:

* https://docs.openssl.org/3.4/man7/provider/[Provider-based architecture] for better modularity

* https://docs.openssl.org/3.0/man7/fips_module/[FIPS 140-3 support]
(https://github.com/openssl/openssl/blob/master/README-FIPS.md[OpenSSL FIPS statement])

* Improved algorithm policy management

* Enhanced performance for various cryptographic operations

Our improvements ensure smooth operation with OpenSSL 3, taking advantage of its
modern features while maintaining compatibility with existing systems.

== Format and encoding enhancements

=== MIME mode support

RNP now includes comprehensive support for
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2045[MIME] mode in literal data
packets, addressing a key aspect of email-based OpenPGP implementations. This
enhancement aligns with the
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880[RFC 4880] specification for
literal data packet handling.

MIME mode support is particularly crucial for email applications where OpenPGP
is commonly used. It ensures proper handling of different text encodings and
line endings, which is essential for maintaining message integrity across
various email clients and systems.

The implementation focuses on:

* Correct interpretation of `Content-Type` headers
* Proper handling of multipart messages
* Preservation of original message formatting
* Improved compatibility with popular email clients like Thunderbird and Outlook

This addition strengthens RNP's position as a versatile OpenPGP implementation,
particularly for email-centric applications and systems requiring robust MIME
handling capabilities.


=== Base64 improvements

The release includes a more flexible
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64[Base64] decoding implementation that now
allows spaces after the checksum. This enhancement improves compatibility with
various OpenPGP implementations and makes the decoder more robust when handling
different formatting styles.

== API enhancements

The FFI (Foreign Function Interface) has been expanded with the addition of the
`rnp_signature_get_features()` function.

This new API allows developers to:

* Query signature features programmatically

* Better integrate RNP into their applications

* Make informed decisions based on signature capabilities

== Additional features and improvements

=== Enhanced signature handling and encryption

* More flexible SHA-1 signature handling has been implemented, allowing clear
distinction between key and data signatures. Support for SHA-1 key signatures has
been extended until 2024-01-19 by default.

* Optional raw encryption capability has been added, enabling encryption of
already signed data.

* A new option to override the current timestamp provides more flexibility in
signature creation and validation.

* Improved packet handling ensures the system doesn't fail completely when
encountering packets with unknown versions.

=== Backend and key management improvements

* Automatic backend feature detection during the build process enhances system compatibility and setup.

* Added support for importing and exporting base64-encoded keys, particularly
useful for https://autocrypt.org/[Autocrypt] headers.

* Implemented a default 2-year key expiration time for better key lifecycle management.

== Looking ahead

This release continues RNP's commitment to providing a robust, flexible, and
modern OpenPGP implementation. The expanded backend support, enhanced signature handling,
and improved format handling lay the groundwork for future enhancements while maintaining
strong compatibility with existing systems.

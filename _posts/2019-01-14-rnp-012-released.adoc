specification which details the implementation and usage of ECC curves in
OpenPGP.

The new implemented curves provide:

* More flexibility in curve selection
* Better compliance with various standards
* Enhanced interoperability
* Improved performance options

==== Brainpool curves

The Brainpool curves (p256, p384, p512) are standardized elliptic curves
developed by the
https://www.bsi.bund.de/EN/Home/home_node.html[German Federal Office for Information Security (BSI)]
as specified in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5639[RFC 5639]. These curves were designed to
provide verifiably pseudo-random parameters, offering an important alternative
to the NIST curves.

Key characteristics of Brainpool curves include:

* Rigorous security verification through public, transparent generation processes
* Three security levels (256-bit, 384-bit, and 512-bit) matching or exceeding RSA 3072-bit to 15360-bit security
* Widespread adoption in European cryptographic applications and standards
* Official approval by BSI for use in high-security applications

In OpenPGP applications, Brainpool curves are particularly valuable when
regulatory compliance or specific security requirements mandate the use of
BSI-approved algorithms. Their implementation in RNP follows the
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5639[RFC 5639] and enables both ECDSA
(for signatures) and ECDH (for encryption) operations.

The inclusion of Brainpool curves enhances RNP's ability to serve European
markets and organizations requiring BSI-approved cryptographic algorithms while
maintaining full interoperability within the OpenPGP ecosystem.

==== secp256k1

The secp256k1 curve, defined by
http://www.secg.org/sec2-v2.pdf[Standards for Efficient Cryptography (SEC)],
is a specialized elliptic curve that has gained widespread recognition primarily
through its use in Bitcoin's cryptographic operations. This Koblitz curve over a
prime field offers unique mathematical properties that make it particularly
efficient for cryptographic operations while maintaining strong security
characteristics.

Key characteristics of secp256k1 include:

* 256-bit security level, comparable to 3072-bit RSA
* Exceptional performance for ECDSA operations
* Mathematically elegant structure that enables efficient implementation
* Strong resistance to known cryptographic attacks
* Widespread adoption and extensive security analysis

In OpenPGP applications, secp256k1 serves dual purposes - it can be used both for ECDSA digital
signatures and ECDH key exchange operations, following the
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6637[RFC 6637] specifications. Its implementation in RNP
enables users to leverage the same high-performance cryptographic primitives used in blockchain
applications while maintaining full compatibility with the OpenPGP ecosystem.

The curve's efficiency comes from its specific parameters that enable particularly fast implementation
of scalar multiplication operations, making it ideal for resource-constrained environments. While
initially controversial due to its unusual generation process compared to NIST curves, secp256k1
has undergone extensive scrutiny and real-world testing through its use in cryptocurrency systems,
establishing itself as a trusted option for high-security applications.

==== x25519

The x25519 curve, designed by Daniel J. Bernstein, represents a significant
advancement in elliptic curve cryptography. It is specifically optimized for the
Montgomery ladder implementation of elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) key
exchange, as specified in https://cr.yp.to/ecdh/curve25519-20060209.pdf[curve 25519].

Key characteristics of x25519 include:

* Designed for high-speed key exchange operations while maintaining strong security
* Provides 128 bits of security, comparable to 3072-bit RSA
* Resistant to various side-channel attacks due to its constant-time implementation
* Widely adopted in protocols like TLS 1.3, Signal, and Wireguard

In OpenPGP applications, x25519 is particularly valuable for secure key exchange
operations, offering an excellent balance of security and performance. Its
inclusion in RNP, following
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-openpgp-crypto-refresh#name-curves-for-elliptic-curve-pu[OpenPGP specification],
enables modern, high-performance encrypted communications while
maintaining compatibility with the OpenPGP ecosystem.

Additionally, the x25519 curve strengthens the overall security framework,
ensuring efficient and robust encryption methods are employed across various
applications. It also positions RNP as a leader in the adoption of contemporary
cryptographic practices, facilitating secure communication in todayâ€™s digital
landscape.

Version: RNP 0.15.2
Release date: 2021-08-05

RNP 0.15.2 introduces significant improvements to key validation, signature
handling, and expiration time calculations. This release focuses on enhancing
compatibility with other OpenPGP implementations while maintaining robust
security practices.

== Introduction

Key and signature validation are fundamental aspects of any OpenPGP
implementation. This release refines RNP's approach to these critical functions,
making it more practical while maintaining security. The changes reflect
real-world usage patterns and improve interoperability with other OpenPGP
software.

Key highlights:

* <<user-id-validation,Enhanced user ID validation>> for expired self-signatures
* <<signature-validation,Improved signature validation>> based on historical key status
* <<expiration-handling,Fixed expiration time calculations>> for better key lifecycle management

Other highlights:

* New FFI function for intelligent key selection
* Enhanced user ID management in FFI
* Improved CLI error reporting
* Better encryption subkey selection
* New key generation options for expiration

[[user-id-validation]]
== Key validation improvements

=== User ID validation enhancements

A major enhancement in this release is the more flexible approach to user ID
validation. The changes include:

* Support for user IDs with expired self-signatures
* Better handling of historical validity periods
* Improved compatibility with existing key infrastructure
* More intuitive behavior for end users

This refinement helps users maintain access to their identities while preserving
the security benefits of key expiration mechanisms.

[[signature-validation]]
=== Signature validation improvements

RNP now recognizes historical validity of keys during signature verification.

Signatures are now validated based on the key's status at the time of signing.
This means a signature is not considered as "invalid" if the key which produced
it was valid during signing, even when it is expired at verification time.

Expired keys no longer invalidate their previously valid signatures. This
approach better aligns with OpenPGP specification requirements and other
implementations.

This change ensures that valid signatures remain verifiable even after key
expiration, which is particularly important for long-term document verification.

[[expiration-handling]]
=== Expiration time handling

Several improvements have been made to key expiration handling:

* Fixed incorrect expiration time calculations in edge cases
* More accurate handling of certification expiration dates
* Better synchronization between primary keys and user IDs
* Improved handling of overlapping validity periods

These fixes ensure more reliable key lifecycle management and prevent unexpected key invalidation.

== Developer improvements

=== FFI enhancements

New FFI capabilities have been added to improve integration flexibility:

* `rnp_key_get_default_key()` function for intelligent key selection
** Automatically selects appropriate subkeys for operations
** Considers key capabilities and validity
** Improves application usability

* Enhanced user ID management
** NULL hash parameter support in `rnp_key_add_uid()`
** Automatic selection of appropriate hash algorithms
** Simplified API usage

* Consistent encryption subkey selection
** Unified approach across different encryption operations
** Improved Autocrypt compatibility
** More predictable behavior for developers

=== Command-line interface improvements

The CLI tools have received important usability improvements:

* Better error reporting for encryption operations in `rnp`

** Clear error messages when encryption fails
** Improved debugging capabilities
** Better user experience

* New key generation options in `rnpkeys`
** `rnpkeys` now provides an `--expiration` option for setting key validity periods
** More flexible key lifecycle management
** Better control over key properties


== Looking ahead

RNP 0.15.2 represents an important step in improving the usability and
reliability of OpenPGP implementations. The changes demonstrate RNP's commitment
to:

* Practical security measures
* Enhanced compatibility
* Improved developer experience
* Better end-user usability

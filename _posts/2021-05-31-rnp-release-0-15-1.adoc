Version: RNP 0.15.1
Release date: 2021-05-28

RNP 0.15.1 delivers critical security fixes and important improvements to key
expiration handling, particularly addressing the Year 2038 problem in
cryptographic applications.

This release also enhances build system flexibility and API robustness.

== Introduction

This release addresses several important areas: a security vulnerability in key
protection, long-term key expiration handling, and build system improvements.
These changes strengthen RNP's security while improving its usability in various
deployment scenarios.

Key highlights:

* <<security-fix,Fixed key protection vulnerability>> (CVE-2021-33589)
* <<y2038-support,Implemented "Year 2038" compatibility>> for long-term key validity
* <<key-expiration,Enhanced key expiration handling>> for complex PKI deployments

Other highlights:

* link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page[man pages] building is now optional for flexible deployment
* Improved FFI feature detection mechanisms
* Enhanced timestamp handling throughout codebase
* Better support for keys with multiple user IDs
* Improved direct-key signature support

[[security-fix]]
== Security improvements

=== Key protection vulnerability fix (CVE-2021-33589)

A significant security fix addresses a vulnerability in key protection
functions:

* Issue: Cleartext key material could remain accessible after `rnp_key_unprotect()`/`rnp_key_protect()` calls
* Impact: Potential exposure of sensitive key data in memory
* Fix: Proper clearing of sensitive data after key operations
* Importance: Critical for maintaining key confidentiality

For detailed information about this security fix, please refer to the
link:/advisories/ri-2021-001[RI 2021-001/CVE-2021-33589 advisory].

[[y2038-support]]
== Year 2038 compatibility improvements

=== Long-term cryptographic operations

The link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2038_problem[Year 2038 problem]
presents unique challenges for cryptographic software:

* The 32-bit `time_t` will overflow on January 19, 2038
* Critical for long-term key validity and expiration
* Particularly important for infrastructure and root certificates
* Affects both key generation and validation

=== Post-2038 date handling

This release implements several improvements to handle post-2038 dates:

* New `rnp_key_valid_till64()` function for 64-bit time handling
* Fixed key expiry checks for dates beyond 2038
* Improved timestamp handling throughout the codebase
* Better support for long-term key validity

These changes ensure that RNP can properly handle keys and certificates with
validity periods extending beyond 2038, which is crucial for:

* Long-term infrastructure planning
* Root certificate management
* Compliance with modern security practices
* Future-proofing cryptographic operations

[[key-expiration]]
== Key management improvements

=== Expiration time handling

The release includes several improvements to key expiration management:

* Better handling of keys with multiple user IDs
* Improved expiration time updates
* Support for link:https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4880#section-5.2.1[direct-key signatures]
* Enhanced primary user ID certification handling

These changes provide more accurate and reliable key lifecycle management,
particularly important for:

* Enterprise key management
* Certificate authority operations
* Long-term document signing
* Complex PKI deployments

== Build system improvements

=== Documentation building options

The release makes link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page[man pages]
building optional, which:

* Reduces build dependencies when documentation isn't needed
* Simplifies minimal installations
* Improves build system flexibility
* Enables faster builds in development environments

== Developer improvements

=== FFI enhancements

New FFI features improve integration capabilities:

* `RNP_FEATURE_*` defines replace raw strings
** More robust feature detection
** Better compile-time checking
** Improved IDE support
** Clearer API documentation

* 64-bit time handling functions
** Future-proof timestamp operations
** Better support for long-term keys
** Improved platform compatibility

== Looking ahead

RNP 0.15.1 strengthens the foundation for secure and reliable OpenPGP
implementations by:

* Addressing critical security concerns
* Preparing for future compatibility challenges
* Improving build system flexibility
* Enhancing developer experience

These improvements demonstrate RNP's commitment to maintaining a robust, secure,
and future-proof OpenPGP implementation.

  Implements AEAD-OCB encryption for OpenSSL backend and enhances key management
  capabilities with GnuPG 2.3+ compatibility
---

RNP 0.17.0 brings significant enhancements to encryption capabilities, key
management, and overall functionality.

This release introduces AEAD-OCB support for the OpenSSL backend, improves
hidden recipient handling, and adds compatibility with newer GnuPG key storage
formats.

== Introduction

This release represents a major step forward in RNP's evolution, focusing on
enhanced security features, improved compatibility with other OpenPGP
implementations, and better key management capabilities. The changes make RNP
more versatile while maintaining its commitment to security and usability.

Key highlights:

* <<aead-ocb,AEAD-OCB encryption support>> for improved performance and security
* <<hidden-recipients,Enhanced hidden recipient handling>> for better privacy
* <<gnupg-compatibility,GnuPG 2.3+ key storage format compatibility>>
* <<offline-keys,Improved offline secret key handling>>

Other highlights:

* SExp parsing code moved to a separate library
* New FFI capabilities for signature export and key verification
* Enhanced CLI features for key management and encryption
* Configurable compile-time options for legacy algorithm support

[[aead-ocb]]
== Enhanced encryption capabilities

=== AEAD-OCB encryption support

A major highlight of this release is the addition of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCB_mode[AEAD-OCB] (Authenticated Encryption with
Associated Data - Offset Codebook) mode support for the OpenSSL backend.

OCB mode offers several advantages over traditional encryption modes:

* Provides both confidentiality and authenticity in a single pass

* Offers better performance compared to other AEAD modes like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EAX_mode[EAX]

* Allows parallel processing of encrypted data

* Reduces overhead in encrypted messages

The implementation now defaults to using OCB instead of EAX when AEAD encryption
is selected, providing better performance without compromising security.


[[hidden-recipients]]
=== Hidden recipient handling

The release introduces comprehensive support for "hidden recipients" during
decryption operations. Hidden recipients, also known as
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880[anonymous recipients]
in the OpenPGP specification, allow encrypting messages without revealing the
intended recipient's key information in the message metadata.

When using hidden recipients, the message's recipient key IDs are replaced with
zeroes, making it more difficult for third parties to determine who can decrypt
the message. This is particularly valuable in environments where metadata
analysis could reveal sensitive communication patterns or relationships between
parties.

RNP now fully supports decrypting messages with hidden recipients and includes
new API capabilities through the `RNP_VERIFY_ALLOW_HIDDEN_RECIPIENT` flag. This
allows applications to explicitly control whether messages with hidden
recipients should be accepted during decryption operations.


This feature:

* Enhances privacy by concealing the intended recipients of encrypted messages

* Maintains compatibility with other OpenPGP implementations that use this
feature

* Provides better security for sensitive communications where recipient privacy
is crucial

== Key management improvements

[[gnupg-compatibility]]
=== GnuPG 2.3+ compatibility

This release adds support for modern key storage formats used by GnuPG 2.3 and
later versions. The new format, based on
https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Sexp.txt[S-expressions], provides a more
structured and extensible way to store OpenPGP keys and their metadata.

RNP can now read and write keys in this format, ensuring smooth interoperability
with recent GnuPG versions. This is particularly important for users and
organizations that maintain mixed environments or need to migrate between
different OpenPGP implementations.

When GnuPG 2.3 was released, it introduced changes in how secret keys are
stored, moving away from the legacy OpenPGP packet format to S-expressions. This
change improved security and flexibility but required other implementations to
adapt. RNP now fully supports this modern approach while maintaining backward
compatibility.


This enhancement:

* Enables seamless key sharing between RNP and GnuPG 2.3+

* Supports modern key storage practices

* Maintains backward compatibility with older formats

[[offline-keys]]
=== Offline key handling

The release includes significant improvements in handling offline secret keys -
keys that are stored separately from the main keyring for enhanced security.
This feature is particularly important for organizations implementing the
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_gap_(networking)[air-gapped] security model
where signing keys are kept on isolated systems.

With these improvements, RNP now provides better support for:

* Automatically distinguishing between online and offline keys during operations
* Smart fallback to available keys when preferred keys are offline
* Integration with hardware security tokens and smart cards
* Support for detached secret key storage on separate secure systems

This enhancement is especially valuable for users who follow security best
practices by keeping their primary keys offline and only using subkeys for
day-to-day operations. The improved handling reduces friction when working with
such configurations while maintaining strong security boundaries.

Users can expect:

* Improved ease of management for keys stored on separate secure storage

* Enhanced implementation of security best practices for key management

* Better support for handling keys stored on hardware security devices

== Developer improvements

=== SExp library separation

The https://github.com/rnpgp/sexp[SExp] parsing library, essential for handling
GnuPG key storage, has been moved to a separate repository. S-expressions,
originally defined in a https://people.csail.mit.edu/rivest/Sexp.txt[1997 spec
by Ron Rivest], provide a structured format for storing cryptographic data. This
format is widely used in security applications, including GnuPG's modern key
storage system.

By separating the SExp parsing code into its own library, RNP achieves better
code organization and enables other projects to benefit from this
implementation. The library provides a robust parser for both canonical and
advanced transport S-expression formats, making it valuable for projects dealing
with GnuPG keys or other cryptographic data storage.

The separation also simplifies RNP's core codebase while maintaining full
compatibility with GnuPG 2.3+ key storage formats through this dedicated
component. Users and developers can expect better maintainability and easier
updates to the S-expression handling code.


This modularization:

* Improves code maintainability

* Allows independent development of SExp parsing functionality

* Reduces the core RNP codebase complexity

=== FFI improvements

New FFI capabilities have been added, including:

* `rnp_signature_export()` for exporting key signatures

* Support for hidden recipient verification via
`RNP_VERIFY_ALLOW_HIDDEN_RECIPIENT` flag

* Enhanced key-related checks for better security validation

== Command-line interface improvements

The CLI has been improved with several new features:

* Default armor message type for `--enarmor` command

* New `--set-filename` command for specifying stored file names

* Enhanced key management with `--add-subkey` and `set-expire` subcommands

* Additional S2K configuration options with `--s2k-iterations` and `--s2k-msec`

* Support for weak hash algorithms via `--allow-weak-hash`

== Security and performance improvements

=== Configurable features

New compile-time options have been added to disable support for legacy
algorithms:

* `ENABLE_BLOWFISH` for Blowfish algorithm support

* `ENABLE_CAST5` for CAST5 algorithm support

* `ENABLE_RIPEMD160` for RIPEMD160 hash function

This allows users to create builds that exclude potentially vulnerable or
unnecessary algorithms, reducing the attack surface.

== Looking ahead

RNP 0.17.0 sets a strong foundation for future development with its improved
encryption capabilities, better key management, and enhanced developer tools.
The modularization of components and addition of modern encryption modes
demonstrate RNP's commitment to maintaining a secure, efficient, and
user-friendly OpenPGP implementation.

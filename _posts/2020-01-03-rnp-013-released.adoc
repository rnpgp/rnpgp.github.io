RNP 0.13.0 brings substantial improvements to the Foreign Function Interface
(FFI) and command-line tools, while also addressing important stability and
security issues. This release focuses on providing developers with more powerful
and flexible APIs while improving the overall robustness of the library.

== Introduction

This release represents a significant step forward in RNP's evolution as a
developer-friendly OpenPGP implementation. The extensive FFI enhancements
provide developers with more granular control over cryptographic operations,
while stability improvements ensure reliable operation in various scenarios.


Key highlights:

* <<key-generation,New key generation API>> for improved programmatic control
* <<armor-handling,Enhanced armor handling>> with better stability and security
* <<key-management,Comprehensive key management functions>> in FFI

Other highlights:

* Streamlined CLI interface with better organization
* Improved RPM package structure
* Enhanced debugging capabilities
* Better version control integration
* Optimized key validation process
* New output handling functions
* Improved feature detection system

== Command-line interface updates

=== `rnp`

* Added `--list-packets` parameters (`--json`, etc.)
* Removed `--show-keys`

=== `rnpkey`

* Removed a few redundant commands (`--get-key`, `--print-sigs`, `--trusted-keys`, ...)
* Added `--secret` option
* Display 'ssb' for secret subkeys


== Foreign Function Interface (FFI) enhancements

=== Key generation and management

New functions:

* A new (non-JSON) key generation API (`rnp_op_generate_create` etc.)
* `rnp_unload_keys` function to unload all keys
* `rnp_key_remove` to unload a single key
* `rnp_key_get_subkey_count`/`rnp_key_get_subkey_at`
* Various key property accessors (`rnp_key_get_bits`, `rnp_key_get_curve`)
* `rnp_op_generate_set_protection_password`
* `rnp_key_get_creation`, `rnp_key_get_expiration`
* `rnp_key_get_uid_handle_at`, `rnp_uid_is_revoked`, etc.
* `rnp_key_is_revoked` and related functions to check for revocation
* `rnp_key_get_primary_grip`
* `rnp_op_generate_set_request_password`
* `rnp_import_keys`

Modified function:

* Expanded bit length support for JSON key generation

=== Output and data handling

New functions:

* `rnp_output_to_path` and `rnp_output_finish`
* `rnp_output_to_armor`
* `rnp_dump_packets_to_output`
* `rnp_output_write`
* `rnp_guess_contents`
* `rnp_key_packets_to_json`/`rnp_dump_packets_to_json`
* `rnp_signature_packet_to_json`
* `rnp_op_set_file_name`/`rnp_op_set_file_mtime`
* `rnp_op_encrypt_set_aead_bits`
* `rnp_op_verify_signature_get_handle`

=== System and debugging

New functions:

* `rnp_version_commit_timestamp` to retrieve the commit timestamp (for non-release builds)
* `rnp_calculate_iterations`
* `rnp_supports_feature`/`rnp_supported_features`
* `rnp_enable_debug`/`rnp_disable_debug`

== Package management

* RPM: Split packages into `librnp0`, `librnp0-devel`, and `rnp0`


== General stability fixes

* Fixed a double-free on invalid armor headers
* Fixed broken versioning when used as a git submodule
* Fixed an infinite loop on parsing truncated armored keys
* Fixed armored stream parsing to be more flexible and allow blank lines before trailer
* Fixed the armor header for detached signatures (previously MESSAGE, now SIGNATURE)
* Improved setting of default qbits for DSA
* Fixed a crash when retrieving signature revocation reason
* Stopped using expensive tests for key material validation

== Looking ahead

RNP 0.13.0 establishes a stronger foundation for developers through:

* More comprehensive FFI capabilities
* Better stability and security
* Improved packaging
* Enhanced usability

These improvements demonstrate RNP's commitment to providing a robust and
developer-friendly OpenPGP implementation.

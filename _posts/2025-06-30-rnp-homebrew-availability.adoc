= RNP now brewing in Homebrew: Installation just got easier

We're excited to announce that RNP has officially joined the ranks of Homebrew's
core formulae! üç∫

Whether you're brewing on macOS or Linux, installing RNP is now as simple as a
single command. Gone are the days of managing custom taps or wrestling with
complex installation procedures

RNP is now part of the official Homebrew ecosystem.

NOTE: Since becoming available in Homebrew core, we're pleased to see steady
adoption!


== What this means for you

The inclusion of RNP in https://brew.sh[Homebrew] core represents a significant
milestone for our project and a major convenience upgrade for our users.

Here's what's changed:

**Before**:: `brew tap rnpgp/rnp && brew install rnp`

**Now**:: `brew install rnp`

That's it. One command, universal compatibility, and you're ready to go.


== Cross-platform brewing excellence

One of the most exciting aspects of this development is that RNP now supports
both macOS Homebrew and Linux Homebrew (Linuxbrew), making it accessible across
the most popular development platforms.


== macOS Support

RNP is now available with full bottle (binary package) support for:

* **Apple Silicon Macs** (M1, M2, M3 series): macOS Sequoia, Sonoma, and Ventura

* **Intel Macs**: macOS Sonoma and Ventura

Whether you're running the latest MacBook Pro with Apple Silicon or maintaining
legacy Intel hardware, RNP installation is now seamless.

== Linux Support

Linux users haven't been forgotten! RNP is also available through Homebrew on
Linux with support for:

* **ARM64 architecture**: Perfect for Raspberry Pi deployments, ARM-based
servers, and the growing ecosystem of ARM development machines

* **x86_64 architecture**: Standard support for traditional Linux desktops,
servers, and development environments

This cross-platform consistency means that development teams can use the same
installation method regardless of their operating system preferences.

== Technical background: From custom tap to core

For those curious about the technical journey, RNP previously required users to
add our custom Homebrew tap (`rnpgp/rnp`) before installation. While this worked
well, it added an extra step and wasn't as discoverable as packages in the core
repository.

The migration to Homebrew core involved:

* Meeting Homebrew's strict quality and maintenance standards
* Ensuring robust cross-platform compatibility
* Implementing proper bottle (binary package) distribution
* Setting up automated testing across all supported platforms

Our custom tap (`rnpgp/rnp`) has been gracefully deprecated with a migration
configuration that automatically redirects users to the core formula.

This means that even if someone runs the old `brew install rnpgp/rnp/rnp`
command, they'll get the official core version.

== Why Homebrew core matters

Being included in Homebrew core brings several advantages:

**Discoverability**: RNP is now easily discoverable through `brew search` and
appears in official Homebrew documentation.

**Reliability**: Core formulae undergo rigorous testing and maintenance,
ensuring consistent installation experiences.

**Performance**: Binary bottles are automatically built and distributed, meaning
faster installations without compilation delays.

**Trust**: Homebrew core inclusion signals that RNP meets the high standards
expected of production-ready software.

**Maintenance**: The Homebrew community helps maintain the formula, reducing the
burden on our development team.

== Dependencies and requirements

The Homebrew formula automatically handles RNP's dependencies:

* https://botan.randombit.net/[**Botan**] (3.8.1): Our primary cryptographic backend
* https://github.com/json-c/json-c[**JSON-C**] (0.18): For JSON parsing capabilities
* https://cmake.org/[**CMake**] (4.0.3): Build system (when building from source)

All dependencies are automatically resolved and installed, so you don't need to
worry about manual dependency management.


== What's next?

This Homebrew integration is just the beginning.

We're committed to:

* Maintaining high-quality Homebrew support
* Ensuring timely updates when new RNP versions are released
* Expanding platform support as Homebrew evolves
* Continuing to improve the installation and user experience

== Try it today

Ready to experience the new simplified installation?

Here's all you need:

[source,bash]
----
brew install rnp
----

That's it! Whether you're on macOS or Linux, Intel or ARM, the command is the
same.

For existing users who previously used our custom Homebrew tap, don't worry --
your installation will automatically migrate to use the core formula on your
next `brew update && brew upgrade`.

Let's brew üçª -- cheers to simpler installations!

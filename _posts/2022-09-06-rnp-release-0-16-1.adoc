  Implements support for OpenSSL 3.0, flexible SHA1 signature handling, and RHEL
  9/Fedora 36
---

RNP 0.16.1 brings significant improvements in security policies, operational
flexibility, and platform support.

== Introduction

The release marks a major milestone in RNP's evolution with comprehensive
support for
https://openssl-library.org/news/openssl-3.0-notes/[OpenSSL 3.0], enabling
seamless integration with the latest enterprise Linux distributions.

Additionally, it introduces more nuanced security policies and several
user-requested features that improve flexibility and ease of use.

Key highlights:

* <<openssl-support,OpenSSL 3.0 support>> for RHEL 9 and Fedora 36 compatibility
* <<sha1-handling,Enhanced SHA1 signature handling>> for key and data signatures
* <<raw-encryption,Raw encryption support>> for flexible data processing

Other highlights:

* Configurable timestamp override functionality
* Improved handling of unknown packet versions
* <<feature-detection,Automatic backend feature detection>> during build
* Base64-encoded key import/export for Autocrypt
* Two-year default key expiration time

[[openssl-support]]
== Platform support improvements

=== OpenSSL 3.0 compatibility

https://openssl-library.org/news/openssl-3.0-notes/[OpenSSL 3.0] has
been recently released and RNP 0.16.1 is the only OpenPGP implementation that
fully supports it.

This feature enables:

* Native compatibility with
https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9[RHEL 9],
https://www.centos.org/centos-stream/[CentOS Stream 9], and
https://getfedora.org/[Fedora 36]
* Support for OpenSSL's new provider architecture
* Improved FIPS compatibility through OpenSSL 3.0's FIPS provider
* Enhanced performance through OpenSSL 3.0's optimizations

The implementation ensures that RNP works seamlessly with these platforms'
default cryptographic backends, eliminating the need for custom builds or
external dependencies.

== Security policy enhancements

[[sha1-handling]]
=== SHA1 signature handling improvements

This release introduces a more sophisticated approach to SHA1 signatures:

* Allows distinguishing between data and key signatures
* Extended support for SHA1 key signatures until January 19, 2024 (2024-01-19)
* More granular control over signature acceptance policies
* Better compatibility with existing key infrastructure

This change allows organizations to maintain compatibility with legacy systems
while gradually transitioning to stronger algorithms.

=== Key expiration defaults

A new security-focused default has been implemented:

* Automatic 2-year expiration time for newly generated keys
* Encourages regular key rotation practices
* Aligns with modern security recommendations
* Helps prevent the use of outdated keys

== Operational improvements

[[raw-encryption]]
=== Raw encryption support

The addition of raw encryption capabilities provides:

* Ability to encrypt already-signed data
* More flexible processing pipelines
* Better integration with existing workflows
* Improved performance for certain use cases

=== Timestamp control

New timestamp override functionality enables:

* Testing of time-dependent operations
* Reproduction of specific scenarios
* Validation of expiration handling
* Better debugging capabilities

=== Enhanced format handling

Several improvements make RNP more robust when dealing with various OpenPGP implementations:

* Graceful handling of unknown packet versions
* Support for base64-encoded keys in Autocrypt headers
* More flexible packet processing
* Improved interoperability

== Developer improvements

[[feature-detection]]
=== Build system feature detection

The new automatic backend feature detection during build:

* Simplifies configuration
* Ensures optimal use of available crypto features
* Reduces build-time errors
* Improves portability

=== API enhancements

New FFI capabilities have been added:

* `rnp_op_encrypt_set_flags()` with `RNP_ENCRYPT_NOWRAP` for raw encryption
* Base64 encoding options for key import/export
* Timestamp override functionality
* Updated security rule functions

== Looking ahead

RNP 0.16.1 sets a strong foundation for future development with its improved platform support and security policies. The changes demonstrate RNP's commitment to:

* Maintaining broad platform compatibility
* Implementing flexible security policies
* Improving usability and integration capabilities
* Supporting modern cryptographic practices

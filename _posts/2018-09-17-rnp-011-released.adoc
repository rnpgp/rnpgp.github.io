RNP 0.11.0 introduces significant improvements to key management and security
features, particularly in the areas of key protection and key operations. This
release focuses on enhancing usability while maintaining strong security
practices.

== Introduction

This release brings important enhancements to how RNP handles key operations and
protection mechanisms. The improvements to String-to-Key (S2K) calculations and
key management make RNP more user-friendly while ensuring robust security.

Key highlights:

* <<s2k-iterations,Dynamic S2K iteration calculation>> for optimal key protection
* <<key-operations,Enhanced key import and merge operations>> for better management
* <<key-protection,Improved key protection mechanisms>> for stronger security

Other highlights:

* Configurable S2K iteration settings
* Time-based iteration calculation options
* Better key distribution workflows
* Simplified key management processes
* Modernized key format support
* Enhanced CLI configuration options


[[s2k-iterations]]
== Security improvements

=== Dynamic S2K iteration calculation

String-to-Key (S2K) is a critical security mechanism in OpenPGP that converts
passphrases into cryptographic keys. With version 0.11.0, RNP introduces dynamic
S2K iteration calculation that automatically determines the optimal number of
iterations based on the system's capabilities.

This feature significantly improves both security and usability by:

* Automatically adjusting iteration counts to match system performance
* Ensuring consistent protection levels across different hardware
* Balancing security needs with practical usability
* Adapting to varying computational resources

Users benefit from enhanced protection against offline attacks without manually
tuning parameters. The system continuously provides optimal security by:

* Maintaining strong protection against brute-force attempts
* Delivering consistent performance across platforms
* Automatically scaling with hardware improvements
* Reducing configuration complexity

For technical details on S2K implementation, refer to
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880[RFC 4880].

The new dynamic calculation system also integrates with RNP's
<<key-protection,key protection mechanisms>> to provide a comprehensive security
solution that stays current with evolving hardware capabilities.

[[key-protection]]
=== Key protection enhancements

The release includes several key protection improvements:

* More sophisticated key derivation mechanisms
* Better adaptation to system capabilities
* Improved resistance to offline attacks
* Configurable protection levels

[[key-operations]]
== Key management improvements

=== Public key extraction from secret keys

RNP 0.11.0 introduces a streamlined process for extracting public keys from secret
keys, addressing a common need in OpenPGP key management. This feature simplifies
the distribution of public keys while keeping secret keys secure.

The improved extraction mechanism provides several benefits:

* Automated public key generation from existing secret keys
* Simplified key sharing workflows that reduce manual steps
* Built-in safeguards to prevent accidental secret key exposure
* Better integration with key servers and distribution systems

This enhancement is particularly useful for users who need to:

* Share their public keys with collaborators
* Upload keys to keyservers
* Maintain separate public and private key rings
* Implement key rotation policies

The feature aligns with OpenPGP best practices as defined in
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880[RFC 4880],
ensuring compatibility while improving the user experience.

=== Support for merging information between keys

Key merging is a critical operation in OpenPGP implementations, especially when
dealing with key management across multiple systems or synchronizing with
keyservers. RNP 0.11.0 significantly enhances its key merging capabilities,
making the process more reliable and efficient while adhering to
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880[RFC 4880].

The improved merge operation intelligently combines key information from multiple sources, ensuring that:

* Existing valid signatures are preserved while new signatures are properly added
* User ID certifications are maintained according to the OpenPGP trust model
* Subkey relationships and bindings remain intact during merges
* Key metadata is combined without conflicts or data loss
* Revocation certificates and updates are properly handled

These improvements are particularly valuable for:

* Organizations managing keys across multiple systems
* Users synchronizing their keyring with public keyservers
* Collaborative environments where keys are shared among team members
* Automated key management systems and PKI implementations

The enhanced merging capabilities align with modern OpenPGP implementations
while providing better reliability and consistency in key management operations.
Users can expect smoother key synchronization processes and reduced manual
intervention when managing distributed keys.

=== Discontinuation of old SSH key support

Discontinued old SSH key support in RNP 0.11.0 includes the removal of legacy
methods and interfaces to ensure better security and maintainability.

== Command-line interface improvements

=== S2K configuration options

New CLI options provide better control over key protection:

* Custom S2K iteration count settings
* Time-based iteration calculation
* Dynamic defaults for optimal security
* Better user control over protection levels

== Looking ahead

RNP 0.11.0 establishes better foundations for:

* Robust key protection
* Simplified key management
* Improved usability
* Modern security practices

These improvements demonstrate RNP's commitment to providing secure and
user-friendly OpenPGP implementations.

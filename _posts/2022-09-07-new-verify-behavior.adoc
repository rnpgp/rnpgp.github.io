  A comprehensive look at RNP's new signature verification approach: simplifying
  security without compromising integrity.
---

RNP version 0.16.1 introduces a fundamental change to OpenPGP signature
verification behavior, making it better aligned with real-world use cases and
user expectations while maintaining robust security guarantees.

This change significantly impacts how RNP validates OpenPGP signatures through
its Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

RNP now requires only one valid signature to succeed (or zero, if data was just
encrypted). Previously, it required all signatures to be valid. To change the
default behaviour, the new function `rnp_op_verify_set_flags()` may be used.


== Understanding OpenPGP signature verification

=== What is OpenPGP signature verification?

OpenPGP signature verification is a fundamental cryptographic process in secure
communications. It serves as a cornerstone of the
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880[RFC 4880] standard, providing
essential security guarantees for digital communications and document
authenticity.

At its core, signature verification ensures three critical aspects of secure
communication:

* *Authentication*: Verifies the identity of the sender by confirming that the
message was created by someone with access to a specific private key

* *Integrity*: Guarantees that the message content hasn't been modified since it
was signed

* *Non-repudiation*: Provides cryptographic proof that the sender cannot later
deny creating the message

The verification process works through public-key cryptography. When sending a
message, the sender creates a digital signature using their private key. This
signature is a unique cryptographic hash that combines the message content with
the sender's private key. The recipient then uses the sender's public key to
verify this signature, confirming both the sender's identity and message
integrity.

In RNP's implementation, signature verification is handled through the FFI
(Foreign Function Interface) layer, making it accessible to various programming
languages and applications. The process is designed to be both secure and
flexible, accommodating different use cases from simple document signing to
complex multi-signature scenarios.

For technical details on implementing verification in your applications, see the
https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/[RNP documentation].

== Evolution of verification approaches

=== Previous implementation: All-or-nothing

Prior to version 0.16.1, RNP adhered to a strict verification model based on
traditional OpenPGP implementations like https://www.gnupg.org/[GnuPG].

This approach prioritized maximum security through rigid verification
requirements, reflecting early cryptographic practices in the
https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880[OpenPGP standard].

The original implementation required that all signatures present in a message be
valid for the verification process to succeed. This meant:

* Every single signature in a message had to be successfully verified
* If any signature failed verification, the entire process would fail
* No distinction was made between encrypted-only content and signed content
* Verification requirements were fixed and couldn't be adjusted for different use cases

While this stringent approach provided strong security guarantees, it led to
several practical challenges in real-world applications:

* Multi-signer documents became problematic when not all public keys were
immediately available in the keyring
* Mixed content handling (combining both signed and encrypted data) was
complicated and often unintuitive
* The system lacked flexibility to accommodate different verification scenarios
or security requirements
* Legacy signatures or situations with partial key availability could cause
unnecessary verification failures

These limitations became particularly apparent in modern usage scenarios, such
as in continuous integration pipelines, automated document processing, or
situations where keys might be stored in different locations or hardware
security modules (HSMs).

The strict verification model also posed challenges for FFI users of RNP, who
often needed more granular control over the verification process or better
feedback about the verification status of individual signatures.


=== New paradigm: Flexible and practical

Version 0.16.1 of RNP introduces a modernized verification model through the
`rnp_op_verify_execute()` function, representing a significant shift from the
traditional approach used in OpenPGP implementations. This new model responds to
real-world challenges faced by users of cryptographic software while maintaining
strong security guarantees.

=== Key features of the new model

At its core, the new verification approach introduces four major improvements:

* It considers verification successful when at least one valid signature is
present, making it more practical for scenarios with multiple signers

* It properly handles encrypted-only data that contains no signatures,
addressing a common use case in secure communications

* It provides a more intuitive way to handle multiple signers, aligning with
how most users expect the software to behave

* It offers flexible verification policies that can be adjusted based on
specific security requirements through the verification API.

=== Practical benefits

The updated verification approach in RNP 0.16.1 reflects modern cryptographic
system requirements while maintaining strong security. This change particularly
benefits organizations dealing with distributed systems and complex key
management scenarios.

==== Distributed key management

In distributed systems where public keys might be stored across different
locations or hardware security modules, the new approach significantly improves
operational efficiency.

Modern enterprises often use
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_security_module[Hardware Security Modules (HSMs)]
or distributed key management systems, making immediate access to all
keys challenging.

==== Flexible key availability

The new model accommodates situations where immediate access to all signers'
public keys isn't practical or possible.

This is particularly relevant in scenarios involving multiple organizations or
when dealing with legacy signatures where some keys might no longer be readily
available.

==== Customizable verification requirements

Different types of documents often require varying levels of verification
stringency. For example, internal documentation might need less strict
verification compared to financial transactions.

RNP now supports this through configurable verification policies, allowing
organizations to match their security requirements precisely.

==== Enhanced feedback mechanisms

The updated system provides detailed feedback about the verification status,
crucial for modern application logic and automation.

This improvement is especially valuable in continuous integration/continuous
deployment (CI/CD) pipelines and automated document processing systems where
detailed verification status information drives subsequent processing steps.

==== Improved interoperability

The new approach enhances compatibility with other OpenPGP implementations like
https://www.gnupg.org/[GnuPG], making RNP more practical for integration into
existing cryptographic ecosystems. This compatibility is essential for
organizations transitioning between different OpenPGP implementations or
maintaining hybrid systems.

These changes position RNP as a more versatile solution for modern
cryptographic applications while maintaining the robust security guarantees
expected from an OpenPGP implementation. The flexibility introduced allows for
better integration with contemporary software architectures and deployment
patterns without compromising on security fundamentals.


== Technical implementation details

=== Core changes in the FFI

The new verification behavior is implemented through several key components:

* `rnp_op_verify_execute()`: The main verification function that implements the
new behavior

* `rnp_op_verify_set_flags()`: Allows fine-tuning of verification requirements

* Enhanced status reporting providing detailed information about each signature

* Improved error handling and feedback mechanisms


=== Verification policies and their implementation

The new verification system in RNP introduces a flexible policy framework that
allows users to choose how strictly they want to enforce signature verification.
This framework is particularly important for organizations that need to balance
security requirements with practical operational needs.

==== Default policy: Single valid signature

The default policy implements a pragmatic approach to signature verification. It
considers a verification operation successful when at least one valid signature
is present in the message. This aligns with most real-world use cases where the
presence of a trusted signature is sufficient to establish authenticity.

Key aspects of the default policy include:

* Success criteria based on finding at least one valid signature

* Proper handling of encrypted-only content without signatures

* Comprehensive status reporting for all signatures present


==== Strict policy: Complete verification

For scenarios requiring maximum security, RNP maintains a strict verification
policy option. This policy, similar to traditional OpenPGP implementations,
requires all present signatures to be valid for the verification to succeed.

This policy is particularly useful for:

* High-security environments where complete verification is mandatory

* Maintaining compatibility with legacy systems

* Scenarios where all signers must be verified


==== Custom verification requirements

RNP provides extensive customization options through its verification flags
system, implemented via the `rnp_op_verify_set_flags()` function. This allows
organizations to:

* Define specific verification requirements matching their security policies

* Implement complex verification workflows

* Balance security needs with operational requirements


These policies are documented in detail in
https://github.com/rnpgp/rnp/[RNP documentation]. The flexibility of this system
makes RNP suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple document
signing to complex enterprise security systems.

== Security considerations and best practices

=== Maintaining security with flexibility

While RNP's new verification approach offers greater flexibility, it's crucial
to maintain robust security practices throughout the verification process. This
balance between flexibility and security ensures that the system remains both
practical and trustworthy.

==== Security fundamentals

The core security principles in OpenPGP signature verification must be preserved
even with a more flexible approach. Modern cryptographic standards, as
recommended by https://www.nist.gov/[NIST] or https://www.ietf.org/[IETF], must
be rigorously applied when validating signature quality and strength.
Organizations should establish and maintain a robust web of trust or PKI
infrastructure to verify the trust level of signing keys. Additionally,
comprehensive key management practices that adhere to industry standards are
essential, encompassing proper key rotation schedules, effective revocation
handling procedures, and secure storage protocols. For compliance and security
analysis purposes, maintaining detailed verification logs is imperative.

=== Implementation recommendations

When implementing OpenPGP signature verification in your applications using RNP,
several key considerations should guide your approach.

These implementation guidelines ensure that RNP's flexible verification approach
can be deployed securely and effectively in production environments while
meeting stringent security requirements.

==== Standard implementations

For most use cases, the default behavior provides an optimal balance of security
and usability. Organizations should implement the standard single-signature
verification approach, which effectively addresses common requirements for
document signing and secure communication. It's essential to develop clear and
comprehensive feedback mechanisms that provide users with detailed information
about the verification status of each signature. Furthermore, proper handling of
both signed and encrypted content must strictly follow the OpenPGP specification
to ensure compliance and security.

==== Enhanced security requirements

In scenarios demanding heightened security measures, organizations should
leverage the `rnp_op_verify_set_flags()` function to implement more stringent
verification policies. For critical documents, supplementary validation checks
should be incorporated, including timestamp verification and organizational
policy compliance assessments. The implementation should be carefully aligned
with specific organizational security policies and compliance requirements to
ensure comprehensive protection.

==== Robust error handling

Error handling forms a critical component of secure operations. Organizations
must implement sophisticated feedback systems that provide detailed information
regarding verification failures and their underlying causes. Comprehensive
logging of all verification attempts, results, and anomalies should be
maintained for security auditing purposes. Furthermore, carefully designed
fallback mechanisms should be implemented to handle edge cases and unexpected
situations while maintaining security integrity.


== Future implications

This architectural change positions RNP for:

* Better integration with modern cryptographic workflows

* Improved compatibility with other OpenPGP implementations

* More flexible security policies that can adapt to different needs

* Enhanced user experience without compromising security

The new verification behavior represents a significant step forward in making
OpenPGP more accessible while maintaining its security guarantees. It
demonstrates RNP's commitment to balancing security requirements with practical
usability.

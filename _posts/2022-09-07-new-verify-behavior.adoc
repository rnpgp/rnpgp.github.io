  Require only single valid signature for successfull verification.

Within v0.16.1 release we decided to update signature verification behaviour (via the FFI API `rnp_op_verify_execute()` call) to better match user expectations.
Since the release by default it would require one valid signature to succeed (or zero, if data was just encrypted). Previously it required all signature to be valid.
In case you need to change the default behaviour the new function `rnp_op_verify_set_flags()` may be used.

For more details please see the documentation for function `rnp_op_verify_execute()`.

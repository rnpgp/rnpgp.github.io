  Resolves CMake build issues introduced in v0.16.2 affecting cryptographic
  algorithm support customization
---

RNP 0.16.2 addresses important build system configuration issues that affected
the customization of cryptographic algorithm support.

This maintenance release ensures proper functionality of build-time options,
particularly for IDEA cipher and Brainpool elliptic curves, where the
`ENABLE_IDEA` and `ENABLE_BRAINPOOL` options caused incorrect behavior.

== Introduction

Build system reliability is crucial for cryptographic software, as it ensures
users can properly customize their builds to meet specific security requirements
and compliance standards. This release fixes issues in the CMake configuration
system that affected how certain cryptographic algorithms could be enabled or
disabled during compilation.

Key highlights:

* <<cmake-fixes,Fixed CMake configuration>> for IDEA cipher and Brainpool curves support
* <<algorithm-support,Improved build-time algorithm customization>> for compliance requirements

Other highlights:

* Enhanced build configuration verification
* Improved documentation for build options
* Better support for regulated environments
* Streamlined build customization process

== Build system improvements

=== CMake configuration fixes

The release resolves issues with two important build configuration options:

* `ENABLE_IDEA`: Controls support for the IDEA (International Data Encryption
Algorithm) cipher

* `ENABLE_BRAINPOOL`: Controls support for Brainpool elliptic curves

These options previously exhibited incorrect behavior, which could lead to:

* Unintended inclusion or exclusion of algorithm support

* Inconsistent build configurations

* Potential compliance issues in regulated environments

=== Algorithm support improvements

==== IDEA cipher implementation

The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Data_Encryption_Algorithm[IDEA (International Data Encryption Algorithm)]
cipher is a significant component in OpenPGP implementations, particularly for:

* Historical compatibility with legacy PGP systems and older encrypted data
* Interoperability with systems that require IDEA for regulatory compliance
* Supporting users who need to decrypt messages from legacy PGP implementations

RNP's implementation of IDEA provides:

* Full compliance with the https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4880[OpenPGP RFC 4880] specification
* Controlled enablement through CMake for organizations with specific compliance needs
* Proper key handling and encryption/decryption operations for IDEA-encrypted content

While newer algorithms are recommended for modern applications, IDEA support remains important for:

* It was one of the original algorithms supported by PGP

* Some organizations still require it for backwards compatibility

* It may be subject to patent restrictions in certain jurisdictions

* It is critical in certain legacy systems where PGP is still used

The fix ensures that the `ENABLE_IDEA` option correctly controls the inclusion
of IDEA cipher support, allowing organizations to make informed decisions about
its use.

==== Brainpool curves implementation

Brainpool elliptic curves are important for:

* Meeting specific security requirements, particularly in European standards

* Providing alternative curves to NIST standards

* Supporting high-security applications that require specific curve
characteristics

The fix ensures proper control over Brainpool curve support, allowing users to
accurately configure their builds according to their security requirements.

== Build configuration best practices

When building RNP with these options, users should:

* Explicitly set `ENABLE_IDEA` and `ENABLE_BRAINPOOL` according to their
requirements

* Verify the final build configuration through RNP's feature reporting

* Document their build-time choices for compliance purposes

== Looking ahead

This release reinforces RNP's commitment to providing a flexible and reliable
build system. Users can now confidently customize their builds to:

* Meet specific security requirements

* Comply with regulatory standards

* Optimize the library for their specific use cases

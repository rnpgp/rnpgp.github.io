  Addresses critical security vulnerabilities affecting input validation and
  secret key handling
---

RNP 0.16.3 is a critical security release that addresses two important
vulnerabilities. This release focuses on strengthening RNP's robustness against
malformed inputs and improving the security of secret key handling.

== Introduction

Security is a paramount concern in cryptographic software, and this release
demonstrates RNP's commitment to maintaining a secure OpenPGP implementation.
The fixes address potential denial of service and key material exposure risks,
making this an important update for all RNP users.

Key highlights:

* <<input-validation,Fixed input validation vulnerability>> (CVE-2023-29479) preventing denial of service
* <<key-handling,Improved secret key handling>> (CVE-2023-29480) for better security

Other highlights:

* Enhanced security best practices implementation
* Improved key lifecycle management
* Updated input processing safeguards
* Strengthened memory handling for sensitive data

[[input-validation]]
== Security improvements

=== Input validation vulnerability (CVE-2023-29479)

The first security fix addresses a vulnerability where malformed inputs could
cause RNP to hang indefinitely. This issue could potentially be exploited to
create a denial of service condition.

The vulnerability:

* Could be triggered by specially crafted OpenPGP messages

* Had the potential to make applications using RNP unresponsive

* Affected all operations involving message parsing


The fix implements proper input validation and adds safeguards against malformed
data, ensuring RNP handles invalid inputs gracefully without entering infinite
processing loops.

[[key-handling]]
=== Secret key handling vulnerability (CVE-2023-29480)

The second security fix resolves an issue where secret keys could remain
unlocked after their intended use.

This vulnerability:

* Could potentially expose sensitive key material in memory

* Affected scenarios where keys were temporarily unlocked for operations

* Created a risk of key material being accessible longer than necessary


The fix ensures that secret keys are properly locked immediately after use,
implementing a more robust key lifecycle management system.

This enhancement:

* Improves the security of secret key handling

* Reduces the window of vulnerability for key material

* Follows the principle of least privilege more strictly


== Security impact and mitigation

These vulnerabilities could affect any application using RNP for OpenPGP
operations.

Users should:

* Update to RNP 0.16.3 as soon as possible

* Review their applications for any cached or stored key material

* Ensure proper key handling practices are followed


== Security best practices

To maintain security when using RNP, we recommend:

* Regular updates to the latest version

* Proper input validation in applications using RNP

* Implementation of secure key handling procedures

* Regular security audits of systems using RNP


== Looking ahead

This release reinforces RNP's security foundation and demonstrates our
commitment to addressing security issues promptly.

We continue to:

* Monitor for potential security issues

* Implement proactive security measures

* Maintain transparency in security-related communications
